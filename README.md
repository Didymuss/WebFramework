# Framework
This is a framework I've been working on to facilitate quicker development of websites (primarily for myself).

While this framework is a work in progress, it will have a complete login system, Stripe implementation and account administration. As well as being designed in MVC with mobile first ideology.


# Things Completed:
* CSS (including media queries)
* Fontawesome/ Bootstrap inclusion.
* Login system
* General layout
* Account administration

# Things partially done:
* Bootstrap header needs some working on. 
* Password/ Email Reset
* Framework Database made, email templates need adding.

# Things barely/ not at all done:
* Automated email implementation [Priority]
* Stripe API has been included but not implemented.
